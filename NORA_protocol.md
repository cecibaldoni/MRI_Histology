# Protocol to visualize 3D atlas of the common shrew (*Sorex araneus*) brain.  
## 
1. Open a web browser  
2. Go to https://www.nora-imaging.com/  
3. Click on: **Online viewer**:

4. On the left of the screen, click on **Workspace**, then upload the files from the folder ``PUT_FOLDER NAME (Saraneus_3Dbrain)``.   Alternatively, you can drag and drop the files directly in the grey area.

5. Once the files are uploaded, you can drop them on the right part of the screen to visualize them: select from the list ``postmortem_rare.nii.gz``, drag it and drop it to ``drop as orthoview``

6. You should now have the orthogonal projection of the common shrew brain. You can navigate thought the slices from each quadrant by scrolling with the mouse wheel, or by clicking the two arrows and then selecting the slice. Note that the motion on one quadrant will automatically set the corrected position in the other quadrants.  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111133332/201111086-e4a01c5d-a115-4794-9fc3-3cc2b2b5128c.png">  
7. Now you can add the different brain regions on top of the scans. From the workspace, select one region of interest and drag it to one of the quadrant, then drop it on ``drop as orthoview``.  
8. All the different regions can be added as overlay:
